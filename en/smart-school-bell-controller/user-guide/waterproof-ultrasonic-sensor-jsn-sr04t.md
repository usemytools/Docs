# Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor JSN-SR04T 2.0 #


## 20 - 600 cm Ultrasonic Waterproof Range Finder

JSN-SR0T4-2.0 ultrasonic distance measurement module can provide 20cm-600cm non-contact distance
sensing function, ranging accuracy up to 2mm; module includes the transceiver of an integrated ultrasonic
sensor and control circuit. Mode one usage and the Division's JSN-SR04T-2.0 module.

This product adopts industrial-grade integrated ultrasonic probe design, waterproof type, stable
performance, all the MCU on the market. 1, the module performance is stable, the measurement distance
is accurate. And foreign SRF05, SRF02 and other ultrasonic rangefinder module comparable. Module high
precision, blind (20cm), stable range is the product successfully to the market a strong basis.

## Features:

1. small size, easy to use;

2. low voltage, low power consumption;

3. high precision measurement;

4. strong anti-interference;

5. integrated closed waterproof cable probe, suitable for wet, bad measurement occasions
